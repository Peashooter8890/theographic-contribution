# Coding

Theographic began at a 3-day hackathon and grew from there. The initial build of a web-based reader uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (static site generator) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). If you are familiar with these tools and want to help with the web app, see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/robertrouse/theographic). To use Theographic data in your own app, refer to the [documentation](documentation.md).

# UX Design

Searching the scriptures should be as easy as searching Google or following link trails on Wikipedia. Interfaces should emulate the beauty found in God's handiwork. Designers are critical to creating a useful, successful application. Contribute your ideas in the form of sketches, prototypes, UI elements, or user research.

# Data Collection

Anyone who uses spreadsheets or databases on a regular basis can help gather, structure, validate, and disambiguate data. [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) serves as the main interface for importing, editing, and exporting. Spatial data is refined by linking biblical places to linked open data available through [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/).

# Data Visualization

Dataviz is an effective medium to connect pieces of stories spread across the Bible and show it as a cohesive whole pointing to Jesus. [Viz.Bible](http://viz.Bible) contains some examples, but there are many more stories to be told. You can lend your unique perspective by creating visualizations in D3, Tableau, or the tool of your choice. 

Here are some ideas for inspiration:
